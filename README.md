# CS4102

I am currently enrolled in this class. Some of the algorithm sure are difficult to solve. Luckily this is the most group-intensive CS class I have taken the entire time at UVA, so a lot of people are with me solving these algorithms.

There are two parts to the class: written proofs and algorithm programs. Here are the homework problems that require me to program. All of my code will tend to be written in standard C and then compiled in a C++ file. I am taking Computer Architecture at the same time as this one, so I wanted to brush up my skills with my favorite programming language.
